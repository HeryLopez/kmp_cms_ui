This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, Desktop (JVM).

## Run local server

### Run local server

This project uses a serverJVM module that launches a local server on localhost port 9090.

The server has two endpoints, GET /jsonlist and POST /jsonlist, which allow you to retrieve and save
a JSON string.

If you use Android Studio as your IDE, you can launch the server with the following command from the
Android Studio terminal.

```shell
 ./gradlew :serverJVM:run
```

This is launched with Gradle, so using Android Studio is the easiest way to get Gradle installed.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into three main modules, each with a specific responsibility:

1. serverJVM

A local server module that exposes two endpoints:

One for synchronizing data

```shell
POST /jsonlist
```

One for retrieving data

```shell
GET /jsonlist
```

It serves as a lightweight backend for local testing and data exchange with the desktop and Android
apps.

2. composeApp

The main application module, containing the core logic and entry points for each platform.

2.1 jvmMain

The source set for the desktop application, built using Compose for Desktop.

2.2 androidMain

The source set for the Android test application, used mainly to preview and verify the UI components
on Android.
Although this could be a standalone Android project, itâ€™s included here for simplicity and shared
development.

3. common

The shared logic module, responsible for building the cross-platform UI and shared domain layer.
This module is used by both `composeApp.jvmMain` and `composeApp.androidMain`.

If needed, it can also be published as a library and reused in other projects.

3.1 commonMain

Contains shared rendering logic, implemented with Compose Multiplatform, to create UI components
that work across all targets.

3.2 androidMain

Holds Android-specific implementations, such as API calls or libraries that differ from the JVM
target.

3.3 jvmMain

Contains JVM-specific implementations, similar to the Android ones, but using libraries or APIs
suited for the desktop environment.
