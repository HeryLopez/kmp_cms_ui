This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, Desktop (JVM).

## Run local server

This project uses a serverJVM module that launches a local server on localhost port 9090.

The server has two endpoints, GET /jsonlist and POST /jsonlist, which allow you to retrieve and save
a JSON string.

If you use Android Studio as your IDE, you can launch the server with the following command from the
Android Studio terminal.

```shell
 ./gradlew :serverJVM:run
```

This is launched with Gradle, so using Android Studio is the easiest way to get Gradle installed.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into three main modules, each with a specific responsibility:

### 1. serverJVM

A local server module that exposes two endpoints:

One for synchronizing data

```shell
POST /jsonlist
```

One for retrieving data

```shell
GET /jsonlist
```

It serves as a lightweight backend for local testing and data exchange with the desktop and Android
apps.

### 2. composeApp

The main application module, containing the core logic and entry points for each platform.

#### 2.1 jvmMain

The source set for the desktop application, built using Compose for Desktop.

#### 2.2 androidMain

The source set for the Android test application, used mainly to preview and verify the UI components
on Android.
Although this could be a standalone Android project, it‚Äôs included here for simplicity and shared
development.

### 3. common

The shared logic module, responsible for building the cross-platform UI and shared domain layer.
This module is used by both `composeApp.jvmMain` and `composeApp.androidMain.

If needed, it can also be published as a library and reused in other projects.

#### 3.1 commonMain

Contains shared rendering logic, implemented with Compose Multiplatform, to create UI components
that work across all targets.

#### 3.2 androidMain

Holds Android-specific implementations, such as API calls or libraries that differ from the JVM
target.

#### 3.3 jvmMain

Contains JVM-specific implementations, similar to the Android ones, but using libraries or APIs
suited for the desktop environment.
